[JSON Forms](https://jsonforms.io) is a framework for the efficient development of form-based UIs. These allow to display and modify model instances in data-centric UIs such as trees, tables and field editors. JSON Forms is the web-version of [EMF Forms](https://www.eclipse.org/ecp/emfforms/). It is the basis of the tree-master-detail model editor of the coffee editor.
